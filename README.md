Example CRUD application using NestJS Just download the files and open them in VC Code, so that it can do the integrations.

To test, use an HTML method tool (GET, POST, PATCH, DELET, etc.), such as Insomnia. Steps:

1. Open a terminal and type the command npm run start:dev to start the application;
2. Open Insomnia and use the URL http://localhost:3000/customers/ with the GET method
A first data record will be displayed to use as a basis for creating (POST) new data, editing (PATCH) and deleting (DELETE). Samuel Luna
